# QueueStack Manager

QueueStack Manager is a C# application demonstrating fundamental data structure concepts, specifically focusing on queue and stack operations. It allows users to perform basic queue operations like enqueue, dequeue, and reverse, while ensuring robust error handling and user-friendly interactions. This project showcases my skills in object-oriented programming, algorithm implementation, and user interface design using Windows Forms.

## Instructions:

### Queue Operations:

Use the UI to add and remove names from the queue.
Reverse the order of elements as needed.

### Stack Operations:

The stack is utilized for the reversal function.

### Example:

Add "John" and "Doe" to the queue, then reverse the first two entries.

### Expected output:

"Doe, John".
