# 🔄 QueueStack Manager

## 🚀 Project Overview and Learning Outcomes

QueueStack Manager is a C# app where I explored the fundamental operations of queues and stacks. Users can easily perform tasks like **enqueue**, **dequeue**, and even **reverse a queue**, all with smooth error handling and a user-friendly interface built using Windows Forms. 💻

This project allowed me to sharpen my skills in object-oriented programming while also diving into key data structures. I applied algorithms to ensure efficient data flow and handled edge cases to create a robust user experience. 🎯
